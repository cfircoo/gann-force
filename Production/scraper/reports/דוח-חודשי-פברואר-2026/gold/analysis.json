    "January 2026 turning point performance review: Of 5 turning dates in January, 3 worked (Jan 2 as low, Jan 16 as low with ~9% rally to next turning point, Jan 29 as high with ~20% total move). Two dates did not work (Jan 8 and Jan 23 - price continued through without reversal).",
    "The primary trend remains bullish - there has been no real trend reversal. Even after a ~20% correction in Gold, the current decline can still be considered a technical correction within the chart's broader uptrend.",
    "Gold is still operating within a broad ascending structure. Professionals observe that the asset is mainly experiencing profit-taking after a sharp rise, not a fundamental directional change - it is already possible to announce this. Gold may have reached its top for weeks and even months ahead.",
    "According to Elliott Wave analysis, the upward trend is composed of three impulse waves (1, 3, 5) and two corrective waves (2, 4). Among the impulse waves, wave 3 is by far the longest and most powerful, typically containing five internal sub-waves.",
    "The updated spiral count shows wave 3 extending toward the $3,500 area, and the previous system's point C marked on the chart began what is effectively wave 5 (the first primary wave), representing the upward cycle that began at the end of 2022 and has already concluded.",
    "At the start of February, the $4,381 level on the weekly chart is expected to serve as a retest for any decline attempts. This level has 6 weekly candles above it, so a decline to it is expected to attract mid-range to long-term buying demand.",
    "If a breakout occurs to the upside, the next Fibonacci 1:3 extension price target is the $5,932 area.",
    "A strong decline initially causes buyer hesitation, but as it develops with peak and trough levels on the 4-hour chart, it will also be possible to time new long entries.",
    "A break of the support zone to the downside signals a more significant correction toward support levels marked on the weekly chart."

    "indicators": "Elliott Wave count suggests Gold is in a complex corrective or new impulsive structure. Wave 3 was the longest and most powerful impulse. The updated spiral places current action around wave 5 territory. Weekly chart shows an ascending channel from 2022 lows near $1,600 with labeled A-B-C corrective structure and D? wave targets. Daily chart shows a 50-period moving average acting as dynamic support. Fibonacci levels (0.382, 0.5, 0.618, 0.786, 1.0) are mapped from recent swing high to swing low. The daily chart does not yet signal a trend change despite sharp late-January declines - only a strong and powerful decline, not a structural bearish reversal pattern."
  },
  "summary": "Gold enters February 2026 in a technically corrective phase after a sharp decline at the end of January, but the primary uptrend remains intact with no confirmed reversal. Key turning point dates are February 3, 9, 13, and 27, with the $4,381 weekly support level being critical - holding above it maintains bullish bias, while a decisive break below shifts the target to $3,886. Seasonal statistics slightly favor bulls with a 76% probability of upward movement around February 16, and the convergence of Fibonacci retracements near the 50-day moving average in the $4,548-$4,638 zone provides the first area where buyers are expected to re-engage.",

    "Even in medium and long-term positions, do not allow accumulated returns to erode. Minimize or exit positions according to the methodology.",
    "Do not chase the decline. Wait for real support zones and price behavior that confirms entry, with a clear pre-defined stop.",
    "A strong decline causes initial buyer hesitation and should be traded cautiously with proper risk management on the 4-hour timeframe.",
    "If returning to trade after a deep correction, only do so after price behavior confirms entry, with a stop-loss defined in advance."
