  "insights": [
    "February is a mildly bearish month for EUR/USD from a seasonal perspective.",
    "There is a one-day weekly cycle centered on the week ending around February 20 - be prepared for a turning point around that time window.",
    "The daily cycle dates between February 1-11 show an unusual concentration of turning points, implying high volatility in early February.",
    "The February 17 turning point aligns with the weekly cycle, making it a potentially important trend-change signal.",
    "When a clear technical level coincides with a turning point date, it offers a better risk/reward trade setup with improved risk-to-reward ratio.",
    "At the current stage, only if the Euro returns below the retracement level and holds below it, would it make sense to consider short trades around the turning point date windows.",
    "In December, EUR/USD showed a classic rally with rising highs and lows - this is how a healthy uptrend should appear.",
    "For the Euro to confirm a sustained uptrend (not just a short-term move within a range), it must halt the correction that started at end of January.",
    "The weekly candle that closed the recent move was a 'falling star' (shooting star) type, meaning sellers exploited the highs to exit the Euro.",
    "A clean and backed breakout above 1.1920 is needed to talk about a clear return to an upward trend, opening the path to the next resistance zone around 1.2230.",
    "Ongoing updates on EUR/USD price action will be published in the Discord community and during weekly live sessions."

The 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of the May-onward rally sits near 1.1390. Weekly chart shows a 'shooting star' candle pattern suggesting sellers are active at the highs. The daily chart zone of 1.1772-1.1814 is the critical decision area: if price holds there and stabilizes, it supports trend continuation upward; if it breaks, it changes the character of the move and increases the probability of a deeper correction."

  "summary": "EUR/USD faces a mildly bearish February from a seasonal standpoint, with a 65% historical tendency to decline from mid-to-late February into March. The critical decision zone sits at 1.1772-1.1814 on the daily chart: holding above supports the bullish case while a break below shifts the outlook toward deeper correction. Traders should watch the dense cluster of turning point dates in early February (especially Feb 3 and Feb 6) and the weekly-cycle-aligned Feb 17 date for potential trend-change signals.",
