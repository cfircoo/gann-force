    "All turning point dates may deviate by +/- one day as part of the methodology. Be prepared for this.",
    "Bitcoin is in a significant long-term test zone. After the downward move in November, December through mid-January became a month of stabilization and attempts to hold.",
    "Despite the stabilization, trading cycles on the upside faded and declines began to expand, until by mid-January Bitcoin started a wave of significant declines that broke the bottom set in November at approximately $80,500.",
    "Bitcoin has a repeating pattern of 35 months of rise followed by 14 months of decline. Currently, the third iteration of this cycle may be occurring, as the 35-month rally ended precisely in October 2025, and since then Bitcoin has fallen approximately 40% from its peak.",
    "The weekly chart provides indications of a possible deep correction. The current decline is strong. In many cases it does not reverse in a single day. Typically a small rebound appears first, but if breakout levels are broken, this could signal the beginning of a longer-term decline potentially lasting 100-150 weeks.",
    "On the daily chart, Bitcoin is building a narrowing consolidation (wedge) pattern. The range is becoming tighter, making it increasingly difficult to predict the breakout direction. The correct approach is to define decision points in advance.",
    "The crypto market is characterized by high dynamics and rapid volatility, therefore real-time monitoring is essential for correct decisions.",
    "Real-time tracking can be the difference between a late reaction and a precise, timely action."

  "summary": "Bitcoin is in a critical long-term test zone for February 2026, having fallen approximately 40% from its October 2025 peak following a repeating 35-month rise / 14-month decline cycle. The four key turning point dates are Feb 3, Feb 10, Feb 17-18 (double date with 100% historical accuracy for price being higher than Feb 6), and Feb 24. Seasonally Bitcoin tends to be bearish in February, but with three strong weekly cycles converging (ending weeks of Feb 13, 20, and 29), the Feb 16-19 window is expected to be particularly volatile and could define the direction for the rest of the month.",
  "previous_month_review": "January 2026 had four turning point dates for Bitcoin. First date (Jan 3): Did not work - failed to block the upward price movement. Second date (Jan 16): Arrived one day early - served as the 'high' of the previous cycle. Third date (Jan 22): Did not work - however, a few days later the price broke it to the downside. Fourth date (Jan 27-28, double date): Worked - reached the double turning point on the way up, and from there the price fell sharply to the downside.",
