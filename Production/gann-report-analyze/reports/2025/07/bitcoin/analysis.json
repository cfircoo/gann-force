    "The crypto market is more dynamic and following real-time developments through the Discord community is highly recommended",
    "Weekly cycle ending on July 11 that coincides with a daily cycle on the same day could serve as a more significant price turning point"

    "indicators": "Weekly chart shows trading cycles with no meaningful volume expansion during recent rally - questioning uptrend strength. Both MACD and RSI showing negative divergence, classic signals for potential correction. However, momentum is weakening gradually rather than collapsing. Daily chart shows consistent attempts to break ATH but selling pressure remains. Before a genuine breakout to new ATH, expect a meaningful technical correction. Fibonacci retracement from the full uptrend provides key support and resistance levels."

  "summary": "Bitcoin is near its all-time highs but accompanied by warning signs including negative divergence on RSI and MACD, and lack of volume expansion ('smart money absence'). The seasonal bias is modestly positive at 64.3% for July, primarily in the second half. The weekly cycle ending on July 11 that coincides with a daily cycle could serve as a significant turning point. While the long-term uptrend remains intact, a meaningful technical correction before any genuine new ATH breakout appears increasingly probable, with potential pullback targets ranging from $97,000-$98,000 down to $74,000 in a negative scenario.",
  "previous_month_review": "In June 2025, Bitcoin had five turning point dates with three providing price turns and one still active (and appearing to work). The first date (June 4-5) stopped the downward move and initiated a ~9% upswing to the next turning point. The second date (June 9) arrived right on time and marked the 'high' of the previous cycle, from which a downward move began. The third date (June 15) saw the price stop and briefly climb the next day but then reversed, becoming a 'continuing cycle' confirming the downward move continuation. The fourth date (June 21) arrived with a one-day deviation combining with a retest to the $98,000 level, marked the 'low' of the previous cycle, and initiated a 10% upward move to the next turning point. The fifth date (June 30) appears to serve as the 'high' of the previous cycle and at the time of writing seemed to be working.",
  "risk_notes": [
    "Negative divergence on both RSI and MACD indicators suggests weakening momentum despite price near highs",
    "Lack of volume expansion ('smart money absence') during recent rally raises red flags about sustainability",
    "Bitcoin has limited historical data (14 years) making seasonal statistics less reliable than other assets",
    "In a negative scenario, price could drop back to the $74,000 support zone",
    "Crypto markets are highly dynamic - real-time updates via Discord community are critical for timely decisions",
    "Leveraged exposure during potential correction phases is especially dangerous given crypto's inherent volatility"
