Turning point dates on Sep 9 and Sep 15 are strong and align with weekly cycles, making them likely trend reversal points.",

  "insights": [
    "The Euro is considered bearish in September from a seasonal perspective - two decade richness patterns point downward",
    "Monthly cycles from the previous month signal a significant high",
    "Turning points on Sep 9 and Sep 15 are strong because they align with weekly cycle endings",
    "Moving into September: The Euro opened August strongly upward after the turning point on Aug 1, reaching resistance levels near 1.1390",
    "If the correction from the weekly chart ends, we expect the Euro to climb back toward the July high level and possibly beyond",
    "The weekly trend momentum continues as a bullish trend for the Euro",
    "From a technical standpoint, there is currently a challenge in establishing the apparent minor trend on the daily chart",
    "On one side, highs are slightly declining, but only the last two lows show rising lows",
    "Level 1.1580 currently serves as support on the daily chart - a break below would lead back to the 1.1390 support area",
    "Support and resistance levels marked on the price chart are important to remember - the combination between support/resistance levels and a turning point date creates optimal conditions for ideal trades",

    "indicators": "Weekly chart: Euro-Dollar weekly chart shows the weekly momentum trend continuing as bullish (Euro rising). After a Fibonacci 50%-61.8% retracement zone held, the correction may be over and Euro could head back to July highs and beyond. Daily chart: Challenge in establishing minor trend direction. Highs are slightly declining while recent lows are rising - mixed signals. 100-day moving average visible on weekly chart providing dynamic support. The combination of support/resistance levels with cycle turning point dates creates the most focused trade opportunities."

  "summary": "EUR/USD enters September 2025 with a seasonal bearish bias for the Euro. The statistical highlights show 69-80% probability of Euro decline around Sep 8, 23, and 25, with a 75% probability that the Euro will close lower on Oct 2 compared to Sep 17. Key turning points are Sep 3, 9, 15, 23-24, and 29, with Sep 9 and Sep 15 being especially strong due to alignment with weekly cycle endings. Technically, the weekly trend remains bullish for the Euro but the daily chart shows mixed signals. Support at 1.1580 is key - a break below targets 1.1390.",
  "previous_month_review": "August 2025 had five turning point dates for EUR/USD - one worked excellently, two worked well, though not all in classic fashion. First date (Aug 1): Represented the low of the movement on a retest, and from it a strong rise of 300 pips to the peak began. Second date (Aug 8): Was challenging to analyze - arrived one day late to Aug 11 (decline combined with retest), then provided a long move of approximately 130 pips to the next turning point. Third date (Aug 15): Arrived near resistance level, served as the high and from it a declining move began to the next date. Fourth date (Aug 21): Arrived via decline from the previous turning point combined with support level, and we received a rise within one trading day. Fifth date (Aug 25): Served as the 'high' of the cycle that started from the previous date, went down to support but returned to the top - a turning point that worked but not in a full and classic way. Next turning point expected around Sep 3.",
