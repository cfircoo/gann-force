    "Time cycles in Oil are signaling sharp changes in September",
    "September is positive for Oil seasonally, but from the other side, all recent decade patterns point downward",
    "The dates September 17 and 18 are particularly strong - expect an important reversal in this time window",
    "In July, Oil managed to hold above the multi-year support band between $64.40-$66.50",
    "With the opening of August, price dropped back below this band - in recent weeks corrected upward and returned to it - but trading cycles remain low",
    "As of writing, three weekly candles closed below this band, and as long as the price stays below it, the probability increases that it will serve as resistance and renew the declining trend",
    "First target in case of such a scenario is the previous low area around $55.30, followed by the $51-$52.70 range",
    "Breaking this range would open a path to decline to the next significant support at $43.40",
    "From the weekly chart: 20-week moving average (blue) can add another layer to sellers' momentum",
    "50-week moving average currently acts as resistance alongside the support band",
    "For an overall trend change from downtrend to uptrend, a clear breakout above the $80 resistance area would be needed - only such a move could signal the end of the downtrend",
    "All key support and resistance levels are marked on the attached daily chart",
    "Oil continues to move downward and is expected to face difficulties on any upward correction attempt"

    "indicators": "Weekly chart: Oil is in a clear downtrend. Three weekly candles closed below the multi-year support band ($64.40-$66.50), turning it into resistance. 20-week and 50-week moving averages both act as overhead resistance. The overall trend is bearish. Daily chart: Shows support around $60.44. Fibonacci retracement levels from the last move provide resistance at $66.89 (0.5) and $69.62 (0.382). Recent upward corrections have been met with selling pressure at the old support band. Time cycles point to September 17-18 as the key reversal window."

  "summary": "Oil enters September 2025 in a clear downtrend with the multi-year support band ($64.40-$66.50) now acting as resistance after three weekly candles closed below it. Despite September being seasonally positive for Oil, all recent decade patterns point downward. Key turning points are Sep 5, 17-18, and 24, with Sep 17-18 being especially strong for a potential reversal. Statistics show 67-70% probability of downward movement around Sep 3, 16, and 19, with 70% probability that Oil closes lower on Sep 20 than Sep 15. Downside targets are $55.30, $51-$52.70, and $43.40. Only a breakout above $80 would signal a trend change.",
  "previous_month_review": "August 2025 had five turning point dates for Oil - one captured a classic quality move, one captured additional quality movement, and the month ended in a classic fashion. First date (Aug 1): Price arrived alongside the last date of July (Jul 31) which marked the high of the movement - from it a declining movement of approximately 10% developed to the next turning point. Second date (Aug 7/8): Worked with a one-day deviation (Aug 8) as the 'low' - stopped the price, but there was subsequent 'sliding' to a new low and a one-day bounce upward - marked as a red date that did not work clearly. Third date (Aug 14): Arrived in a rally combined with resistance level (retest from chart) and thereby marked the high of the movement - from it a decline began to the next turning point. Fourth date (Aug 20-21 double cycle): Arrived via decline and provided the low of the movement (slightly above the low) - from it a rise of approximately 5% began to the last turning point on Aug 28. Fifth date (Aug 28): Arrived in a rally combined with resistance level - at time of writing, appears to mark the high of the cycle and a possible descending cycle.",
