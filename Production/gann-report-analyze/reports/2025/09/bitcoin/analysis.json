  "summary": "Bitcoin enters September 2025 with bearish seasonal bias (66.7% of years end September negative). Key turning points are clustered around Sep 3, 7, 14, 22-23, and 28, with an especially strong statistical signal showing 86% probability of downward movement between Sep 18-24. Despite the long-term bullish trend, the weekly chart shows negative divergences on RSI and MACD, and the daily chart highlights a critical support zone at $107,500-$109,300. Expected volatility window is Sep 21-24. A break below $107,500 could trigger a correction toward $98,230 and potentially $87,500.",
  "previous_month_review": "August 2025 had four turning point dates for Bitcoin - one did not work, two worked partially. First date (Aug 7): Did not work - price stopped there for two days but then broke upward, becoming a continuing cycle. Second date (Aug 14-15 double cycle): Despite the breakout to highs on Aug 14, price reversed powerfully downward (approximately -10%) and continued declining to the next turning point. Third date (Aug 20): Worked partially - stopped the declining move and within several days climbed upward, then reversed back to declines after approximately 4.5% rise. Fourth date (Aug 27): Also worked partially - stopped the declining move and climbed for several days, then reversed back to declines after approximately 3.5% rise.",
