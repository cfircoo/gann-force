The monthly chart reveals two significant patterns: (1) AB=CD pattern where wave CD equals AB in length, with price stopping exactly at point D target, suggesting beginning of expected correction. (2) The ratio between decline wave BC and subsequent rise wave CD is exactly 1:2, reinforcing the significance of the D target point. RSI divergence present on weekly chart. MACD showing weakening momentum. The pattern since November 2023 resembles a classic bearish wedge."

  "summary": "S&P 500 enters February 2025 near all-time highs with significant technical correction signals building. Key turning dates cluster around Feb 3, 13, 18, and 26-27 with high volatility expected mid-month (Feb 10-21). Trump's trade war tariffs add substantial macro risk, while the market's extended rally since October 2023 and technical bearish wedge pattern suggest a meaningful correction could begin, with support levels at 5,653 and 5,142-5,260 being critical to watch.",
  "previous_month_review": "January 2025 had four turning point dates that all successfully captured extreme points and significant moves: Date 1 (Jan 2) arrived on time and marked the low, initiating a two-day rally. Date 2 (Jan 8, arrived Jan 7) marked the high of the move from Date 1, followed by decline. Date 3 (Jan 14-15, arrived Jan 13) marked the low with a strong 5.5% upward move that was stopped only at the next turning date. Date 4 (Jan 27, arrived Jan 24) marked the very high of the move, followed by a strong decline.",
  "risk_notes": [
    "Financial leveraged instruments carry significant risk and can lead to substantial losses in a short time - a careful risk management strategy is required",
    "Turning point dates are indications of potential reversals, not guarantees - there can be deviations of +/- 1 trading day",
    "When a date acts as continuation of the existing trend, it serves as a hint for a timing correction within the overall movement",
    "When holding a long position at a double date, it is recommended to lock in some profits at resistance zones",
    "In case of significant resistance, consider taking profits or even trading the reverse direction (short)",
    "If price confirmation indicates a downward reversal, it may be an opportunity to trade short",
    "Use stop-loss protection and update protective stops for long positions at key levels - especially around the 5,653 level",
    "Apply the highway driving analogy from the October report - maintain portfolio stability and respond flexibly to market movements"
