      "description": "April 2025 is identified as a critical month where multiple Gann time cycles (15, 30, 45, 60, 75, and 90 year cycles) converge simultaneously. Historical April events include the Oklahoma City bombing (1995), Iraq-Iran wars (1980), Vietnam War escalation (1965), and the Stresa Front (1935). This convergence suggests elevated probability of significant global events."

      "description": "Current reports indicate extraordinary concentration of American military power in the Middle East (7 B-2A bombers, dozens of KC-135 tankers, C-17A transports, F-35 fighters plus carrier groups). The cyclical pattern suggests this is not coincidental and aligns with the historical pattern of escalation during these time windows."

      "theme": "Seasonal Bullishness vs Cyclical Bearishness",
      "description": "Most assets show positive seasonal bias for April (S&P one of top 3 months, Oil best month, EUR/USD positive, Bitcoin 64% positive). However, the cyclical analysis warns of potential trend changes and deterioration. This creates a tension between seasonal expectations and deeper cyclical patterns."

  "risk_rules": [
    "Never label turning dates as 'high' or 'low' in advance - the direction only becomes clear as price approaches the date.",
    "Each turning date has a tolerance of +/- 1 trading day from the marked date.",
    "When two dates appear close together (double cycle), the first typically creates a correction and the second restores the original trend.",
    "A 'continuing cycle' date means the date does not reverse the trend but confirms continuation - this requires different positioning.",
    "Maintain 30-40% of portfolio in liquid non-equity assets during periods of uncertainty.",
    "Use stop-losses at significant support/resistance levels. Lock in partial profits at resistance zones.",
    "The combination of turning date + technical level alignment + dominant trend direction produces the highest probability setups.",
    "Avoid leveraged ETF positions during elevated uncertainty periods.",
