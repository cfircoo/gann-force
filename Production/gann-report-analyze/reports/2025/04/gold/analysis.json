  "insights": [
    "Gold returned to its uptrend in the previous month after the correction that began on February 20 proved to be just a technical correction before continuation higher.",
    "The breakout above the all-time high set in November established a new paradigm - the minor bearish trend has returned to being a bullish trend after the breakout.",
    "The February report correctly identified that the decline starting February 20 was a technical correction before continuation of the rise - this proved accurate.",
    "Weekly chart shows continuation of the wave pattern structure with the previous months' analysis remaining valid - N-wave pattern with targets at higher levels.",
    "The retest to approximately $3,050 appears to have provided a long opportunity and combined with a turning point date would create a high-quality trade setup.",
    "Support zone on the daily chart between $2,988-$3,008 represents the next key support if the $3,050 retest level fails.",
    "Important to understand that when trading against the dominant trend (which is up), exercise extra caution with position sizing and wait for clear technical signals before entering.",
    "Weekly cycle ending around April 4 and April 18 are the more powerful ones - with April 14 turning date aligning with the stronger weekly cycle."

    "indicators": "Daily chart shows the minor downtrend has reversed back to uptrend after the breakout above all-time highs. Weekly chart displays a strong N-wave bullish continuation pattern. The wave structure from previous months continues to project higher targets. Three technical confirmations converge (symmetry, Fibonacci, historical support) at the 5,120-5,140 area for S&P which indirectly supports gold as a safe haven. Gold's price action is being driven by both technical breakout and macro-geopolitical uncertainty."

  "summary": "Gold is in a strong uptrend having broken above its all-time high from November. The seasonal bias is mildly positive for April, with statistical probabilities of 67-70% for rises around early-to-mid April. The key date to watch is April 14, which aligns with a stronger weekly cycle and could trigger a significant directional move. The retest of $3,050 after the breakout provides a potential long entry, with support at $2,988-$3,008 if the retest fails.",
  "previous_month_review": "In March 2025 there were four turning point dates and all except one functioned as turning points - an exceptionally strong month. March 7 (arrived 1 trading day late at March 10): served as the turning point for the downtrend, rallying ~4% to the next date. March 14: briefly halted the trend for one day only then broke out - did not lead to a trend change, became a continuing cycle. March 20: arrived exactly on time, served as the high and triggered a correction to the next date. March 27: arrived exactly on time, served as the low of the previous cycle, from which gold bounced ~4% higher at time of writing.",
  "risk_notes": [
    "When trading against the dominant uptrend during brief corrections of several days, exercise extra caution.",
    "In such situations, wait for clear reversal signals on intraday charts (4-hour to 30-minute) before entering.",
    "When trading in the direction of the overall trend against the immediate correction, the risk-reward is typically more favorable but corrections can still be sharp.",
    "Trading counter-trend may lead to discomfort during the trade and could also frustrate the trader psychologically.",
    "The combination of turning point date alignment with technical support/resistance and dominant trend direction produces the highest probability setups."
