      "description": "The period between May 16 and May 23 is flagged across multiple assets as carrying the highest potential for exceptional market volatility. This window aligns with physical earthquake risk (atmospheric models), the Panama Canal geopolitical flashpoint (May 16-17), and multiple cycle convergences across S&P, Bitcoin, Oil, Gold, and EUR/USD."

      "description": "The report's overarching message is that historical cycle patterns are actively manifesting across all tracked asset classes simultaneously. The author emphasizes that 'whoever understands time - stops fearing the future' and that the methodology provides a compass in turbulent markets."

  "risk_rules": [
    "The period May 16-23 requires heightened risk management across all positions and asset classes.",
    "Profitable long positions in stocks/indices should be partially realized or have stops tightened to below the last weekly/daily low.",
    "Leveraged ETF positions (x2, x3) remain at full risk and should be approached with extreme caution.",
    "When approaching a double cycle date (two dates close together), the first often creates a correction in the existing trend, and the second returns the trend to its original direction.",
    "Turning point dates indicate a potential reversal IN the existing trend at the +/- 1 day window - they do not predict direction. Direction must be determined by the price action as the date approaches.",
    "Never settle for just the turning point dates - read the full review for proper context. The true meaning is embedded in the deep and comprehensive analysis.",
    "Emotional leverage is as important as financial leverage - not every temporary rise is a return to normal.",
    "The methodology is time-based, not based on guessing, gut feeling, or news headlines.",
    "Stay connected to the Discord community for real-time updates as these are monthly guideposts, not daily trading signals.",
    "All content is for educational purposes only - not investment advice."

  "april_2025_review_summary": {
    "sp500": "All four turning point dates worked with high precision. Dates: 3-4.4 (double cycle, continuing), 11.4, 18.4, 24-25.4 (double cycle). The 07.04 date marked the major April low, 14.04 was an exact cycle peak, and 21.04 marked the end of the short decline wave. Three highs and lows perfectly captured.",
    "bitcoin": "Four dates: 1.4 (+1D deviation to 2.4 marked high), 14.4 (marked high), 21.4 (marked low, +12% rally), 25.4 (marked high but only halted movement). Mixed results with the cycle dynamics not being as clean as other assets.",
    "eurusd": "Four dates: 4.4 (+1D to 7.4, ~570 pips move), 11.4 (high of cycle, ~200 pip decline but did not sustain), 22.4 (-1D to 21.4, monthly high, ~230 pip decline), 29.4 (head-and-shoulders high, ~150 pip decline). Three of four dates captured key turning points.",
    "gold": "Three dates: 9.4 (exact timing, marked low, ~9% rally), 14.4 (halted for one day only, became continuing cycle), 25.4 (marked high area, actual high 22.4, started correction). Two of three successfully marked key reversals.",
    "oil": "Four dates: 1.4 (exact, marked high, ~18% decline), 7.4 (did not deliver reversal), 15.4 (no opportunity), 22-23.4 (exact, double cycle, marked high at resistance, ~12.5% decline). Two of four produced significant profitable moves totaling ~30% in April alone."
