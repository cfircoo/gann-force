    "May 2025 is identified as a rare convergence point where multiple time cycles of 45, 60, 75, and 90 years align simultaneously - described as 'something big is approaching'.",
    "April marked the moment when the boundaries of global balance were breached. May continues this seismic shift with actual earthquake risk around May 16-18 according to weather cycle models.",
    "The period between May 16-23 is expected to have potential for exceptional market volatility, not necessarily a reason for panic but a call for focused response.",
    "Trading cycles are expanding - this is a clear technical warning signal indicating buyers are entering but not buying with strength, suggesting potential further downside.",
    "The CNN Fear & Greed Index is a key tool to monitor. When the index reaches extreme zones (above 80 or below 20), it pays to understand the implications. Current threshold level is around 40.",
    "Geopolitical developments are materializing: Iran tensions, India-Pakistan regional conflict escalation (60 and 90-year cycles), China's internal cycles converging, US internal polarization intensifying.",
    "The Panama Canal is flagged as a sensitive geopolitical point around May 16-17, with not just systemic but also geopolitical implications.",
    "Key recommendation: Anyone holding profitable long positions in stocks/indices should realize or lock in partial profits, or at minimum tighten stops below the last weekly/daily low.",
    "Leveraged ETFs (x2, x3) remain at full risk. Emotional leverage is equally important - not every temporary rise is a return to normal.",
    "The methodology is not based on guessing, gut feeling, or news - it is based on time and understanding what happens beneath the surface."

    "support": [
      {"level": "4835", "description": "Bottom established at 4,835 points during April's decline. Could serve as the base of the correction for the coming months. The index stopped exactly at this zone within 0.33% of the upper boundary."},

      {"level": "5700", "description": "As of early May (02.05), the index reached the 5,700 area - the beginning of significant resistance. The index rallied approximately 12% without any technical correction, entering resistance with D9 and RSI indicators converging."}
    ],
    "indicators": "Trading cycles are expanding, which is a clear technical warning. Buyers are entering but not with aggressive buying power. Two significant moving averages (20-week and 50-week) are positioned in the 5,700-5,775 resistance zone, strengthening the case for seller activity there. The index climbed 12% straight without correction, and now classic indicators like D9 and RSI signal overbought conditions at resistance. The weekly chart shows an N-pattern forming at resistance, suggesting a shift in the resistance pattern."

  "summary": "May 2025 is described as a rare time convergence where cycles of 45, 60, 75, and 90 years align, making it potentially one of the most significant months in decades. The S&P 500 faces strong resistance in the 5,700-5,775 zone while key cycle dates on the 2nd, 9th, 16th, 22nd, and 27th provide timing for potential reversals. The overall seasonal bias is slightly positive, but the period May 15-23 carries heightened risk of exceptional volatility due to converging geopolitical and financial cycles.",
  "previous_month_review": "April 2025 turning point dates performed exceptionally well. Date 1 (April 3-4, double cycle) was a continuing cycle that preceded the sharp decline to the monthly retest zone around 4,800 points, with a deviation of one day forward (April 7), producing a significant upward move of approximately 13% to the next turning point. Date 2 (April 11) marked the high in the ES futures one day prior (April 10), initiating a 6.5% decline. Date 3 (April 18) arrived with one trading day deviation (April 21) and marked the low of the move, from which an approximately 8% rise developed. Date 4 (April 24-25, double cycle) was a continuing cycle that maintained the upward trend toward the next month's turning point.",
