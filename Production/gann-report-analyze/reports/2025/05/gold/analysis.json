  "insights": [
    "Gold continues to present a fascinating picture from a wave structure perspective in the coming months, based on Elliott Wave Theory.",
    "According to the theory, an uptrend consists of three impulse waves (waves 1, 3, and 5) and two corrective waves (waves 2 and 4), with wave 3 typically being the strongest and most dominant. The count clearly shows five waves including five internal secondary waves.",
    "Based on the current count shown in red lines on the chart, it appears we are currently at wave number 5 - which is expected to be the wave completing the entire uptrend that began since late 2022, marking a four-wave structure.",
    "If an inverted N-pattern forms on the weekly chart, this could signal the beginning of the deepest correction since the start of the entire bull run from October 2022, a significant and meaningful event.",
    "However, in a market trending upward at all-time highs, it is hard to estimate a precise target from the beginning. The correction represents an 'open sky' situation.",
    "Using geometric pattern analysis (AB=CD with Fibonacci extensions), point D arrived in the zone where resistance was received from the chart itself during April (approximately $3,516). If the uptrend continues this month, the next Fibonacci extension target is around $3,782.",
    "Support zones based on Fibonacci spiral: $3,136 / $3,022 / $2,909 (not plotted on the attached chart to avoid visual clutter).",
    "Gold in March saw the secondary trend return to its rising direction and reunite with the primary trend. The decline that began around May 20.02 should be viewed as a technical correction before continued upside.",
    "When trading against the overall direction - even when there is alignment with a turning point date - the correction will typically be 'heavy' (slow, non-continuous), which can lead to discomfort and sometimes a sense of emotional toll.",
    "Two weekly cycles with significant time implications are dated at May 2 and May 23, with several specific daily dates in between that align with the monthly turning point dates."

    "indicators": "Elliott Wave count suggests we are in Wave 5 of the broader uptrend from October 2022 - the final wave before a major correction. Fibonacci extensions and geometric AB=CD patterns converge at the $3,516 resistance and $3,782 target. The weekly chart shows the potential for an inverted N-pattern which would signal the beginning of the deepest correction since late 2022. The 50-day moving average and Fibonacci 61.8% retracement converge near $3,137-$3,165 support. Trading volumes and cycle analysis suggest the uptrend remains intact but nearing completion."

  "summary": "Gold enters May 2025 with a strongly positive seasonal bias (88% probability of upward movement around May 19) and key turning point dates on May 2, 13, 22, and 29-30. Technically, Elliott Wave analysis suggests we are in the final Wave 5 of the bull run from October 2022, with resistance at $3,516 (AB=CD point D) and $3,782 (next Fibonacci extension). While the primary trend remains bullish, the wave structure warns that a significant correction could begin once this wave completes, potentially the deepest since October 2022.",
  "previous_month_review": "April had three turning point dates with two successfully marking key moves. Date 1 (April 9) arrived exactly on time, marked the low of the movement, and from there an approximately 9% upward move developed to the next turning point. Date 2 (April 14) halted the movement for one day only and broke out - it failed to lead to a trend change and turned into a continuing cycle (identified in advance in Discord as a possibility). Date 3 (April 25) marked the price high, though the actual high was on April 22; from there, the price began correcting downward toward the next turning point at May 2. Important understanding: it is not necessary to identify the start of every cycle precisely - sometimes the movement begins from one turning point and the next point is several days away, allowing joining the trend after it has already started.",
  "risk_notes": [
    "Elliott Wave 5 completion could trigger the deepest correction since October 2022 - timing is uncertain but the structure warns of significant downside risk.",
    "In an 'open sky' uptrend at all-time highs, it is difficult to set precise price targets - expect volatility.",
    "When trading against the overall direction (counter-trend corrections), moves tend to be heavy and psychologically challenging.",
    "An inverted N-pattern on the weekly chart would be the most significant bearish signal since the entire bull run began.",
    "The $3,516 resistance level from the AB=CD pattern was already tested in April - another approach could trigger significant selling.",
