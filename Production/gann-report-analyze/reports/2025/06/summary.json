    "June 2025 is described as one of the most historically significant months in recent memory, sitting at the intersection of 82-year and 164-year revolution/war cycles",
    "Geopolitical risk is elevated: Trump's birthday (June 14) falls within Fibonacci 61.8 years from JFK assassination, and historical presidential assassination/upheaval cycles cluster in June/July",
    "Most assets show a pattern of potential strength in early June, weakness/correction mid-month, and recovery late June",
    "Gold and S&P 500 face potential Wave 5 / double-top technical patterns suggesting major trend changes could be approaching",
    "Oil remains in a structural downtrend while other assets are near highs - a clear divergence to monitor",
    "The report heavily emphasizes that cycle dates are turning points (not directional signals) - the actual direction depends on price action, trend, and technical levels at those dates",
    "Cross-asset trading across all five assets is recommended for higher overall success probability",
    "The Discord community provides real-time updates and trades that complement the monthly report"

  "risk_rules": [
    "Cycle dates indicate POTENTIAL turning points with +/- 1 day tolerance - they do NOT guarantee direction",
    "Always combine cycle dates with technical analysis (support/resistance, chart patterns, indicators) before entering trades",
    "Take partial profits gradually and trail stops to momentum-based levels on the daily chart, not distant weekly support",
    "Options traders should consider using puts as hedges on certain positions given the elevated volatility window",
    "Leverage through 2x-3x ETFs carries amplified risk during cycle convergence periods",
    "Mental/emotional management is as important as the financial plan - avoid impulsive decisions and be selective in trade choices",
    "When trading counter-trend, only enter after a clear technical reversal signal on intraday charts (4h, 30min)",
    "When a 'double cycle' occurs (two dates close together), the first date often causes a reversal and the second reinstates the original direction",
    "None of the report content constitutes investment advice - it is for educational purposes only. Seek professional financial advice",
    "Stay connected to the Discord community for real-time updates during the month, as market conditions evolve"
