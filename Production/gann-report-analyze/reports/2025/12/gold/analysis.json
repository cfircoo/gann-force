  "insights": [
    "The basic fundamentals are clear in technical analysis: the trend continues to rise, the chart does not show a real reversal. Even after an approximately 11% correction from the October average, Gold still operates within a broad uptrend",
    "The important question every analyst must ask is whether something in the movement structure has changed or whether this is just a temporal decline that depresses prices before the continuation of the trend upward",
    "As long as there is no clear downward pattern, the direction continues to be bullish - do not rush to sell before the continuation of the upward movement",
    "After a long period of consolidation and settling, Gold broke upward powerfully. The rally that began in the summer rose one level after another until early October, where a deeper correction began",
    "Elliott Wave theory (Gliott/wave analysis) is still relevant - wave 5 is still active. The current wave structure indicates we are in wave 4 of the inner waves (or that we have recently completed wave 4 in late October)",
    "The preferred scenario (second option): according to wave spiral rules, wave 3 is the longest and most powerful. It contains up to five inner waves. The current spiral, updated from previous months, shows wave 3 continuing to the $3,500 area (previously estimated $2,790). From point C marked on the current chart, wave 5 has started, in which we are currently in wave 4 of the 5 inner waves",
    "If this scenario breaks upward, Fibonacci targets are: first target at $4,637 (1.618 ratio of wave AB) and second target at $4,995 (2.0 ratio of wave AB)",
    "These levels represent potential key turning stations in the current wave - areas where significant profit-taking or the beginning of a deep correction at the weekly chart level could occur",
    "The daily chart momentum is being worn down, the delicate balance is shaking. After October declines, the daily chart stabilized in November and began to rebuild a minor upward pattern with rising highs and lows",
    "The current test level is at $4,245. In order for Gold to appear to be returning to attack the high level, this level needs to be broken upward",
    "Support at $3,886 represents the last weekly support level and if it breaks downward, a deeper correction into Fibonacci levels would follow",
    "The time window around Dec 5 is a weekly cycle that marks a central junction that could indicate the continuation of the trend"

    "indicators": "The weekly chart shows a strong bullish Elliott Wave structure with wave 5 still active. A key Fibonacci-based spiral is being tracked. The daily chart shows minor uptrend rebuilding after October correction. The 50-day moving average acts as dynamic support. The momentum on daily is fading but the delicate balance has not yet broken. The key test level is $4,245 for confirming upward continuation. The time window around Dec 5 is a weekly cycle junction of significance."

  "summary": "December is seasonally positive for Gold, with the second half of the month showing particularly strong upward bias (70-75% probability). Key turning dates are Dec 4, Dec 11, Dec 16, Dec 23, and Dec 29-30. The broader Elliott Wave structure remains bullish with wave 5 still active and potential Fibonacci targets at $4,637 and $4,995. However, the daily momentum is weakening and the $4,245 resistance must be broken to confirm continued upward movement. Weekly support at $3,886 is critical - a break below would trigger a deeper correction.",
  "previous_month_review": "November had four Gold turning dates. The first (Nov 3) worked partially for one day and then reversed. The second (Nov 10-11, double date) - we expected a high that actually arrived on Nov 13; a downward movement followed until the Nov 18 turning date. The third (Nov 18) worked and served as the low of the price movement from the previous cycle; from it an upward move began to the next turning date. The fourth (Nov 26) did not work.",
  "risk_notes": [
    "While the November uptrend is relevant, the daily chart shows a momentum that is being worn down - caution is warranted",
    "Turning dates may deviate by +/- 1 day from the noted date",
    "The rise seen in November could indicate wave 4 completion (bullish) but could also be an exhaustion move",
    "A break of $3,886 weekly support would trigger a deeper correction into Fibonacci levels of $3,693-$3,827",
    "The probability of further declines remains elevated until a strong and sustained break above $80 (the $4,245 level) is confirmed",
    "The wave spiral rules present two scenarios: a less likely one where wave 5 ends at ~$4,400 (Fibonacci 1.272 of AB), and a preferred scenario where it extends to $4,637-$4,995"
