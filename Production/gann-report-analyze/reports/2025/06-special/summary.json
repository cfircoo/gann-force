  "overall_summary": "This special June 2025 report from Cycles Trading is a powerful consolidation of their annual forecast (February 2025) and monthly reports for May and June 2025, demonstrating the predictive power of Gann-based cyclical analysis. The report proves that the Israel-Iran attack on the night of June 12-13, 2025 was explicitly predicted months in advance through cyclical analysis. The central thesis is that June 2025 represents a rare convergence of multiple long-term historical cycles (82-year war cycles, 164-year revolution cycles, 50-year Yom Kippur War cycle, Fibonacci-based presidential crisis cycles) that point to continued and potentially escalating volatility in markets and geopolitics. Key actionable dates cluster around June 13-15 (peak convergence) with a potential sharp decline window of June 15-27. The report strongly recommends defensive positioning: reducing long exposure, tightening stops, considering put protection, and avoiding excessive leverage. Looking ahead, June is described as 'just the gate' - war cycles of 82-84 years do not open in one day but awaken in stages, with July already defined in the annual report as the heir to this wave."
