    "The annual forecast published in February 2025 explicitly predicted: 'The central time window focuses on mid-June, especially between the 13th and 15th of the month' and 'There is special concern around June 14' and 'Israel enters a 50-year cycle from the Yom Kippur War - an eruption is likely to occur'",
    "In May and June warnings were intensified: 'Iran has not yet responded with a direct attack' and 'Revolution and war cycles return in June to a convergence point'",
    "Everything happened exactly on time as written in advance - not hindsight but cyclical reading that preceded the events",
    "William D. Gann's method, operating for over 120 years, remains remarkably accurate to this day",
    "The period May 16-23 was identified as having potential for exceptional market movements - this was confirmed by actual price action",
    "June 2025 is entering one of the key turning months of the year, not just from a financial markets perspective but also at the historical, social, and geopolitical level",
    "War cycles of 81-84 years are currently active - in 2025 we are in a 'war cycle' tracked with remarkable precision by Gann. Wars repeat in cycles of 81-84 years from the previous war",
    "Year 2025 sits exactly at the intersection point of multiple historical cycles: 82 years from WWII, 164 years from the American Civil War - a double cycle of 82 years",
    "Fibonacci ratio 61.8 from JFK assassination (November 1963) points to September 2025 as cycle peak. Two presidential assassinations historically occurred in June/early July at precise cyclical intervals",
    "Those holding profitable stock/index positions should consider reducing exposure partially or at minimum tightening stops to below the last weekly low, or if too far - on the daily chart",
    "In swing trading with cycle turning dates, the approach is dynamic - not a reason to act differently",
    "Anyone in options territory may consider using 'puts' as protection on certain portfolio positions",
    "Leveraged ETFs (x2, x3) remain fully valid - such volatility turns leverage into risk rather than opportunity",
    "Emotional leverage is no less important than financial leverage - time to remember not every rise is a return to normal, sometimes it is just preparation for further declines",
    "The 180-year cycle: In 1845 Texas and Florida joined the United States. 180 years later, this historical cycle returns - may signal not just geographical expansion but a tendency toward local sovereignty demands and destabilization of core nations"

Key cycles active: 250-year, 240-year, 144-year (Fibonacci), 84-year war cycle, 72-year (Fibonacci), 50-year (Yom Kippur War cycle for Israel), 45-year (from 1980), 42-year, 30-year, 10-year. Fibonacci ratios (61.8, 144) used as time measurement tools. Three precise turning dates in April-May (7th April, 14th May, 21st May) all confirmed with zero deviation. Recommendations: take profits gradually, tighten stop losses to below daily/weekly chart lows, consider put options for portfolio protection."

  "summary": "This special June 2025 report from Cycles Trading consolidates the annual forecast and May/June monthly reports, demonstrating how Gann-based cyclical analysis predicted the Israel-Iran attack on June 12-13 and the market turbulence with remarkable precision. The central window of June 13-15 represents a convergence of multiple historical time cycles (82-year war cycles, 164-year Civil War cycles, Fibonacci-based cycles) that point to continued volatility and potential sharp market declines through June 27. The report strongly advises reducing long exposure, tightening stops, and being prepared for an extended period of instability that may continue into July and beyond.",
  "previous_month_review": "May 2025 confirmed the cyclical forecasts: April 7 marked the central low (one day from predicted turning point), May 14 was an exact cycle peak from which a renewed decline began, and May 21 marked the end of the short-term downward wave. Three dates, three precise moves. The 4,800 S&P 500 support zone identified as a buy area held as predicted. The market subsequently rallied but the report warns this was setting up for the mid-June cyclical peak. The April report had warned 'something big is approaching' with time cycles of 45, 60, 75 and 90 years all converging, and May proved this correct as geopolitical tensions escalated and markets showed increasing fragility.",
  "risk_notes": [
    "Multiple 81-84 year war cycles are currently active - historical pattern suggests major military conflicts recur at these intervals, and 2025 sits at their exact intersection",
    "Fibonacci 61.8 from JFK assassination (Nov 1963) points to September 2025 - two presidential assassinations occurred in June/July at cyclical intervals, raising concern around Trump's June 14 birthday",
    "Federal Reserve expected to reduce market influence - potential disruption in international trade agreements and inflationary pressures intensifying",
    "Leveraged ETFs (x2, x3) carry extreme risk in current environment - volatility turns leverage into risk not opportunity",
    "Physical earthquake risk flagged for mid-May period based on space weather models - literal ground-shaking possible around May 16-18",
    "The 180-year cycle of territorial expansion/sovereignty movements may destabilize core nations including the United States",
    "Russia, China, India-Pakistan, Israel-Palestine, Middle East stability all flagged as simultaneous geopolitical risk factors",
    "Not every price rally represents a return to normal - some rallies are merely setups for further declines",
    "These cyclical forecasts provide clarity not certainty - they give direction and when direction is clear, even storms can be navigated, but they do not guarantee specific outcomes",
    "The week of June 9-13 specifically, may reveal itself as one of the most sensitive weeks of the year - spoken in terms of clear cyclical structure that began building months ago"
