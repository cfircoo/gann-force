  "seasonal": "In the last 14 years, March was statistically divided such that in 7 years there was a rise and in 7 years there was a decline. Bitcoin does not have a long history of years so the seasonal statistics are less attractive compared to other assets in the report. Slightly positive bias based on 7-year data showing Bitcoin tended to trade at a higher price on April 2 than on March 6 in 5 out of 7 years (approximately 71%).",

    "After a period of roughly three months of sideways consolidation, Bitcoin's movement in February brought significant downside with the break below the support band between $90,750-$92,350.",
    "In the previous month's report, two key observations were noted: First, if support breaks downward, the central target zones are between $86,000-$72,000, with an additional support area for possible reset between $68,300-$73,800 (based on candle body at bottom and wick at top). Bitcoin indeed reached $78,200 during the downward movement following the break.",
    "Second, the weekly chart Fibonacci-based geometric patterns (wide Fibonacci's) were applied. The rally wave AB ran from November 2022 through March 2024. The parallel line was placed on point C, showing point D terminating wave CD at equivalent length to AB, converging at the $107,832 level as a target zone.",
    "Whether Bitcoin's price will mark this symmetry or is it a phenomenon beyond understanding remains to be seen. For now it appears so, as it has dropped approximately 28%.",
    "On the daily chart, the break downward is clear with resistance zones appearing sharply higher. In the short term, the 20-day moving average at the 50% Fibonacci level of the AB decline acts as resistance. These indicators combined with a turning point date could provide indication of a potential short-term reversal that could occur only after the actual moment of the turning point.",
    "Long-term investors should examine monthly support levels and existing holding positions. For the second perspective, in a long-range view of investors, check support levels in a rising price structure and bullish direction. Once a level like this breaks, we need to change the fundamental assumption and separate from the investment due to fear of more significant decline.",
    "The crypto market is more dynamic, and tracking real-time developments is critical. It is recommended to stay updated through the Discord community where you can find real-time updates."

    "indicators": "Daily chart shows clear break downward with resistance zones appearing sharply above. The 20-day moving average at the 50% Fibonacci level of the AB decline is resistance. Weekly chart geometric patterns show wave AB=CD convergence at $107,832. Combined with turning point dates, these resistance indicators could provide short trade indications. The AB=CD pattern from the Fibonacci geometric analysis on the weekly chart suggests a 1:1 relationship between the rally waves."

  "summary": "Bitcoin in March 2025 faces uncertainty after a significant breakdown from its three-month consolidation range. The February break below $90,750-$92,350 support led to a decline reaching $78,200, and recovery attempts will likely struggle at former support turned resistance. Key turning dates are March 3, 7, 17-18, and 26, with the seasonal data being statistically neutral (50/50 over 14 years). Long-term target of $107,832 from geometric patterns remains but requires recapturing broken support levels first.",
  "previous_month_review": "February 2025 had four turning point dates for Bitcoin. Date 1 (Feb 3): Arrived exactly on time, marked the low of the movement and jumped the same day from the daily low to the daily high by approximately 11%. Date 2 (Feb 11): Arrived exactly on time but did not mark the 'high' of the preceding rising cycle. From it began a sideways movement that did not allow understanding of the cycle. Date 3 (Feb 18): Arrived exactly on time, marked the 'low' of the sideways movement. After a two-day rise, the cycle reversed and broke downward, turning into a continuing/extending cycle date. Date 4 (Feb 27): Arrived exactly on time. Despite the sharp decline in Bitcoin, at this date the downward movement ended and from it began a rising cycle of approximately 20% until the first turning date in March (March 3).",
  "risk_notes": [
    "Bitcoin is among the assets with the highest potential for sharp movements in both directions.",
    "Long-term investors should be cautious about timing entries and exits based on turning point dates.",
    "Missing a significant movement could neutralize the advantage that short-term traders have in timing the market.",
    "When a support level breaks, the fundamental assumption must be changed and positions should be re-evaluated for potential further significant decline.",
    "The crypto market is more dynamic than others, and real-time tracking of developments is critical.",
    "Statistical data for Bitcoin is limited (only 14 years of history) making seasonal analysis less reliable compared to other assets."
