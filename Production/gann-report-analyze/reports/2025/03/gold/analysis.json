  "insights": [
    "In the long-term uptrend, every decline constitutes a technical correction before continuation of rallies, and this remains the case until proven otherwise. Every decline is in the context of a changing resistance pattern forming a downward N-pattern on the weekly chart.",
    "Gold, which in the previous month saw the secondary trend returning upward and aligning with the direction of the primary trend, has resumed its uptrend across all timeframes following a breakout of the peak level established in November.",
    "Note that despite the decline starting at the Feb 20 date, here too we catalog this decline as a technical correction before further advances.",
    "One of the foundational insights of the technical analysis approach (attributed to Charles Dow, the father of the method) is 'Dow Theory' - providing the real ability to operate even when prices decline and the news and environment create 'artificial fear'. This has been working for over 120 years.",
    "From the weekly chart rally waves since October 2022, examining the wave pattern using Fibonacci extensions: the rally appears to consist of 5 waves total - 3 impulse waves in the trend direction (waves 1, 3, 5) and 2 corrective waves against the trend (waves 2, 4). Wave 3 is typically the longest and strongest. If we are currently in wave 5, Gold in the long term is expected to be in the $3,010-$3,042 range.",
    "There is one monthly cycle, but it is not strong, and together with the weekly cycle ending around March 14, they point to a significant turning point in that time window. Therefore it is worth watching for a trend change at that time.",
    "Also on March 28 there is a strong additional turning point date that appeared from multiple different indications that could lead to a material change in movement.",
    "Pay attention - you do not need to catch the cycle from its beginning. Sometimes when the next turning point date is far away, you can join within a few days' movement in intraday charts (decline to a 30-minute chart level) in order to capture the movement that continues until the next turning date.",
    "The combination of a turning point date with chart formation and trading with the dominant trend provides the best success rates and most profitable trades with tight stop-loss and good risk-reward ratio."

One monthly cycle exists but is not strong. Weekly cycle ending around March 14 combined with monthly creates significant turning point window. Daily chart shows dominant buy-side momentum. Moving averages on daily chart show 50-day and 100-day creating support below price in the short-to-medium term. The weekly Fibonacci levels at 50% and 61.8% provide key retracement support for any pullback."

  "summary": "Gold in March 2025 faces the seasonally most negative month of the year while being in a strong long-term uptrend targeting the $3,010-$3,042 zone. Key turning dates are March 7, 14 (aligned with weekly cycle - significant window for trend change), 20, and 27-28 (strong from multiple indications). The dominant approach is to buy dips in line with the primary uptrend, while being mindful that the seasonal negativity and cycle analysis showing 2 out of 3 decades ending in decline could create temporary pullback opportunities.",
  "previous_month_review": "February 2025 had three turning point dates for Gold, all of which were successfully traded in the Discord community. Date 1 (Feb 3): Arrived on time. In the community in real-time, after the breakout of the peak, we understood it would serve as a 'low' and took it long. Date 2 (Feb 12): Arrived on time. Given the rising trend, here too in the community in real-time, we identified it as a date that would serve as a 'low' and took it long. Date 3 (Feb 20): Arrived on time. Served as the 'high' of the month and of the movement starting from the previous turning date. In the first stage we avoided taking a short position on Gold given the dominant rising trend characterizing it throughout the month. Subsequently, with the development of a price decline pattern (N downward on 4-hour/hourly chart), we executed a short that allowed us to capitalize on the significant downward movement.",
  "risk_notes": [
    "March is seasonally the most negative month for Gold - exercise caution with long positions.",
    "Despite the strong uptrend, corrections can be sharp and sudden.",
    "Historical cycle analysis shows 2 out of 3 significant decade-cycles ended in decline.",
    "When trading counter to the dominant trend, wait and watch for the reversal on intraday charts (4-hour or 30-minute minimum) before entering.",
    "The turning point on March 28 is strong and from multiple indications - expect potential material change in movement direction around this date."
