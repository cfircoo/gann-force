  "risk_rules": [
    "Time is more important than price, but price must confirm the turn - wait for price confirmation at turning point dates before acting",
    "Turning point dates are not prophecies - they are indicators of potential change windows with high historical probability",
    "A continuation date (cycle continues) means the trend is expected to persist until the next turning point; it does not mean the price will reverse",
    "Double dates (two turning points close together, like Jan 2-3 for S&P 500 or Jan 27-28) suggest the first date often creates a correction, and the second restores the original trend direction",
    "When working against the general trend direction, the statistical probability is weaker and trades should only be taken after clear confirmation signals",
    "Leverage feels like genius when the market climbs but becomes cruel the moment the market corrects - manage position sizing accordingly",
    "Work with a clear head, not high pulse - this is the key trading principle",
    "The more assets you trade from this report, the more chances you have to finish the month profitably - diversification across all five assets improves odds",
    "January's year-defining nature means building awareness rather than aggression - set alerts, plan scenarios, but wait for price to confirm",
